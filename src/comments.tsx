      <h2>Potential improvements of the API structure</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Format:</strong> To enhance consistency and streamline
          data handling, I recommend adopting a standardized naming convention
          for keys across all attributes in the API responses. Consistent use of
          camelCase or snake_case, rather than mixing capitalization as observed
          in the data, can significantly improve readability and align with
          industry-standard practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>API Key or Token Authorization:</strong> Implementation of an
          authentication mechanism using API keys or tokens to validate and
          authorize incoming requests. This step ensures that only authorized
          users or systems can access the API endpoints. Implementing an
          authentication header, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth tokens,
          can improve security.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The ActOnSprectrum API Data Structure:</strong> There isn't a
          specific payload or data structure explicitly specified for the
          ActOnSpectrum API in the documentation.
        </li>
