// Potential improvements of the API structure

// 1. Data Format
// To enhance consistency and streamline data handling, I recommend adopting a standardized naming convention for keys across all attributes in the API responses. Consistent use of camelCase or snake_case, rather than mixing capitalization as observed in the data, can significantly improve readability and align with industry-standard practices.

// 2. API key or Token Authorization
//Implement an authentication mechanism using API keys or tokens to validate and authorize incoming requests. This step ensures that only authorized users or systems can access the API endpoints.Implementing an authentication header, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth tokens, can improve security.

//3. The ActOnSprectrum API Data structure
//There isn't a specific payload or data structure explicitly specified for the ActOnSpectrum API in the documentation.
